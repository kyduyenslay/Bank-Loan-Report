### Tools
- Advanced Excel: Data cleaning, Pivot Table analysis, and dashboard design.
- SQL: Data extraction and initial KPI calculation.
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Date Standardization: Used the Text to Columns (DMY) command to convert text-based date strings into functional date objects, ensuring accurate calculation of MTD and MoM metrics.
- Conditional Logic Application: Implemented logic to categorize loans as "Good Loans" (Fully Paid/Current) or "Bad Loans" (Charged Off) based on specific status criteria.
### Data Analysis
- KPI Calculation: Developed primary Key Performance Indicators, including Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received to monitor bank cash flow.
- Portfolio Quality Assessment: Quantified the percentage of "Good" vs. "Bad" loans, including the total principal disbursed and total payments received for each category.
- Grid View Aggregation: Engineered a comprehensive Loan Status Grid View to analyze metrics like Average Interest Rate and MTD Funded Amount by specific loan stage.
- Performance Tracking: Established Month-to-Date (MTD) tracking for all core metrics to monitor real-time variations in lending performance.
### Results & Recommendation
#### Conclusion
- Holistic Monitoring: The report serves as a one-stop solution for accessing vital loan data and tracking portfolio health efficiently.
- Performance Visibility: By distinguishing between Good and Bad loans, the bank can clearly quantify the percentage of successful repayments versus losses.
- Trend Identification: The use of diverse chart types allows the bank to communicate loan-related insights effectively and identify long-term lending trends.
#### Recommendations
- Risk Mitigation: Closely monitor the 'Bad Loan' principal amounts and MTD changes in 'Charged Off' status to adjust lending criteria in high-risk regions or categories.
- Strategic Resource Allocation: Use the Monthly Trend and Regional Analysis to anticipate peak demand periods and identify states with significant lending activity for targeted marketing.
